# Automatics - Valheim Mod

Automatics is a mod that automates the tedious tasks of life in Valheim. Most of its features exist in existing mods, but it has been re-designed to make it easier for me to use.

## Features

### Automatic door

Automatically opens and closes the door near the player. The interval and distance to detect the player can be changed from the configuration.

### Automatic map pinning

Automatic pinning animals, monsters, floras, veins, dungeons, etc. that exist around the player to the map. The pinning allows for each object and the detection range of the object can be changed from the config.

**Custom map icons**

Using png files and csv, you can customize icons for pins added by
Automatic map pinning.

-   **Files to be prepared**

    -   CustomMapIcon.csv: Describe information such as which icons to customize and which images to use. Detailed specifications are described below.

    -   ICON\_NAME.png: Image files required for each icon. A png file with transparency information is preferred.

Place the prepared files in the following configuration.

-   **/Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/Automatics/Textures**

    -   CustomMapIcon.csv

    -   ICON\_1\_NAME.png

    -   ICON\_2\_NAME.png

**Format of CustomMapIcon.csv**

Four columns are defined in this csv: TARGET, FILE, WIDTH, and HEIGHT. The first line is considered a header and is skipped, so information should be written in the second and subsequent lines.

-   TARGET: Specify a display name such as "Boar" or an internal name such as "$enemy\_boar"; If a display name is specified, the custom icon will be applied if the target display name partially matches the specified display name. If you specify an internal name, the custom icon will be applied only if the target internal name matches the specified internal name exactly.

-   FILE: Specify the name of the image file to be used for the icon. It is best to keep the image size between 16x16 and 32x32, as too large an icon will be obtrusive.

-   WIDTH: Specify the width of the icon.

-   HEIGHT: Specify the height of the icon.

**Example files**

I donâ€™t feel I have explained it very well, so I have prepared a sample file. Please click [here](https://github.com/eideehi/valheim-automatics/blob/main/package/extra/custom-icon-example/Automatics/Textures) to check the structure of the file that actually works. You can also download the [zip file](https://app.box.com/shared/static/n8l56o2l5or24bx1061jjly4jnm21gm3.zip) and check the operation on your PC.

### Automatic processing

Refueling pieces that need fuel. Deliver materials to pieces that
process materials, and store items produced by pieces. These tasks can be automated via containers around the piece.

### Automatic feeding

Animals and other creatures that consume food will be able to consume food from containers and the player's inventory, not just from food on the ground.

### Automatic repair
It can automatically repair items when the player is near a crafting station or when the crafting station GUI is opened or automatically repair nearby pieces when the player has a hammer equipped.

## Console commands
Automatics add a few commands to help the user.

### automatics [COMMAND]
Displays the usage of commands added by Automatics.

- COMMAND: Command name to display usage. If there is an exact match, it will be displayed. Otherwise, it will display the first partially matched command found. If omitted, the usage of the automatics command itself is displayed.

### printnames (WORD|REGEXP)
Outputs internal or display names that contain the specified string or match the specified regular expression.

- WORD: A text contained in the internal or display name. (e.g. $enemy_, $item_, $piece_, Boar, Mushroom, Wood door); All partially matching internal and display names are output.
- REGEXP: A regular expression of the internal or display name to be output. Must be prefixed with "r/". (e.g. r/^[$]item_, r/^boar$)

Examples:

- printnames greydwarf
- printnames r/deposit_[ct].+$

## Configurations

I recommend using [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager).

[![Configuration Menu](https://app.box.com/shared/static/3v57rjpauzzyv0xeugohnw8bn2ye3q2h.png)](https://app.box.com/shared/static/vfzsn69i950l48er2u69tssod6xxsh8u.jpg "Configuration Menu (Click to view full size)")

Please check the [details from GitHub](https://github.com/eideehi/valheim-automatics#configurations) as the README will be too large to upload to Thunderstore if all the optional details are described.
