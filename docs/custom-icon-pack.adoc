Using png files and json, you can customize icons for pins added by Automatic mapping.

== Directory structure
In order for Automatics to recognize the custom icon pack, the directory must first be placed in */Valheim/BepInEx/plugins*; If your icon pack is named *AWESOME-ICON-PACK*, the directory structure of the required files is as follows.

====
/Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/AWESOME-ICON-PACK::
  automatics-child-mod:::
  Textures:::
    custom-map-icon.json::::
    ICON_1.png::::
    ICON_2.png, ICON_3.png, ...::::
====

Next, let's look at the details of each file.

automatics-child-mod::
This file is required for Automatics to recognize the icon pack and must be placed directly under *AWESOME-ICON-PACK*. The extension must not be present, and zero byte files are fine.

Textures::
Folder where custom-map-icon.json and image files are placed.

custom-map-icon.json:::
This file is used to define custom icons and should be placed directly under the *Textures*. The format is described in detail in <<Format of custom-map-icon.json>>.

ICON_X.png:::
An image file of the icon. PNG files with alpha channel are preferred. Prepare as many as you need.

== Format of custom-map-icon.json
See *custom-map-icon.json* below. The first item applies the boar.png icon only to the level 1 Boar. Nametag is hidden and the icon is displayed at a 2x scale, as specified in `options`; The next item applies the deer.png icon to all levels of Deer. Since `options` is omitted, the nametag is visible, and the icon is displayed at 1x scale.

Now let's look at the details of each item.

target::
  Describes information about the target to which the icon is applied.

  name:::
    Specify a display name such as `Boar` or an internal name such as `$enemy_boar`; See the {uri-name-matching}[Matching by "Display name" and "Internal name"] section for the difference between matching by display name and internal name.

  metadata:::
    Describe if you want to further narrow down the target by information other than a name. If omitted, the icon will be applied to all targets matching the name.

    level::::
      By setting up this field, it is possible to assign a different icon for each level of animal or monster. Note that the unstarred state is level 1. One star is level 2 and two stars are level 3.

sprite::
  Describes information about the image file.

  file:::
    Describes the path to the image file. This path is handled as relative to the Textures folder. In other words, if icon1.png is Textures/icon1.png, the file Textures/sub/icon2.png will be loaded; if sub/icon2.png, the file Textures/sub/icon2.png will be loaded.

  width:::
    Width of the image file. Please describe the size including the transparent area.

  height:::
    Height of the image file. Please describe the size including the transparent area.

options::
  Options to control pins in Minimap. You can omit the options if you don't need it.

  hideNameTag:::
    When true, the name tag on the map pin will be hidden.

  iconScaleLargeMap:::
    Specify the scale of the icon on the map when zoomed in. 0.0 or higher enables it.

  iconScaleSmallMap:::
    Specify the scale of the icon on the minimap. 0.0 or higher enables it.

== Example files
